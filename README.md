# payment-gateway
This is an exercise for the coding chagelling from Checkout.com


<a href="https://github.com/rafaelqueiroz89/payment-gateway/actions?query=workflow%3A%22.NET+Core+build+script%22+branch%3Amaster">![.NET Core build script](https://github.com/rafaelqueiroz89/payment-gateway/workflows/.NET%20Core%20build%20script/badge.svg)</a> status from the <i>master</i> branch

Ideally we should not expose Domain objects to the external world, instead we should create an Adapter or use a framework like AutoMapper to transform my Domain object into a DTO and transfer it to different systems

My branch master is protected and doesn't allow a force push if the development branch is with build fail

# Business Discussion
We will be taking in account that the business needs 2 different flows, the first is requesting a payment from the merchant and the second one is retrieving a made transaction request. The actors of the whole system are:

1. Shopper: Individual who is buying the product online. 
2. Merchant: The seller of the product.
3. Payment Gateway: Responsible for validating requests, storing card information and forwarding payment requests and accepting payment responses to and from the acquiring bank. 
4. Acquiring Bank: Allows us to do the actual retrieval of money from the shopperâ€™s card and payout to the merchant. It also performs some validation of the card information and then sends the payment details to the appropriate 3rd party organization for processing.
